## Repo structure

`hardware/` for schematics, pcb, bom and simulation.

`firmware/` for src, include, lib, tests and build.

`mechanical/` for cad, drawings, 3d_print and renders.

`docs/` for architecture and datasheets.

`scripts/` for flashing and test automation.

Keep `docs/architecture/` current from day one: pin assignments, baud rates and message formats. Last year's teams named integration the hardest part of the project.

## Design constraints

LiPo batteries are banned from the lab and from all projects. Other lithium chemistry needs prior approval, a built-in BMS and a fireproof storage bag. Any battery needs a matching charger, a fuse within inches of the cell, an inline cut-off switch and proper connectors.

Target materials budget is about $1,000.
